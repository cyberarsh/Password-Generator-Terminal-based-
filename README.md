- Include/exclude character types:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Save generated passwords to a file (\`passwords.txt\`).
- Simple terminal-based interface.

### Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: \`random\`, \`string\`

### Setup Instructions
